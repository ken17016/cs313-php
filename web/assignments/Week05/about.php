        Once upon a time far away there was a poor little surf boy and this surf boy had a dream,
        a big dream. His dream was to collect and sell all the oddities that he could.
        In a way he had the dream of being an interspatial entrepreneur and hoped that
        he could reach his influenced far across the universe. This was just a dream though for this poor orphan boy.
        With no friends, family, or relatives to take care of him in his time of need.
        What got him by was his wit and quick tongue and was able to work his way into the mining community on the lonely planet of Gerbash.
        Everything was looking bleek for Tibbits, until on faithful day when all of that changed.
        A loan merchant mercenary ship crashed down on Gerbash and with the help of Tibbits they where able to fix the ship.
        Do to his impeccable timing and can-do attitude they decide to take him along and that’s when his journey began.
        As Tibbits traveled along with this group of rag-tags, he had to opportunity to learn and grow his
        business and begin to build his vast empire as we know it today.

        Sir Tibbits began his vast empire of a business from a lonely cruiser
        he had found abandoned in the south quadrant of the radar galaxy while
        out making deliveries with his fellow mercenaries. This abandoned ship
        was beat up and so destroyed, yet Tibbits just couldn’t take his gaze
        from it, he left his mercenary group to go and procure this space vessel.
        Once he had it in his care, he spent every Unit he had saved to fix it
        up and began out on his adventure to procure goods that could be sold
        across the Universe. It was a rough couple of years for Sir Tibits as
        he was scrounging by, but slowly and steadily his goods and income
        grew and grew. His fame increasing along the way, as people began to
        come aware of this wonderful procurer of goods from every walk of life
        and far reaches of space that none would dare to venture. Some may say
        that even he could traverse Universes and get goods only the dreamiest
        of imagines could come up with. His ways where secrete and unknown, but
        everyone knew that whatever wanted, Tibbits would deliver.
